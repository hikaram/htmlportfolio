				<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

																								  <h2>Beyond the Surface</h2>
																								  <p>Personal project, 2010, duration: 03:14.</p>
																								  <p>&nbsp;</p>
																								  <p>Artist / Director: Egor Kraft</p>
																								  <p>Camera: Ivan Apollonov<br />
																									Production: Egor Kraft<br />
																									Actor: Donatas Grudovic<br />
																									Sound: Cosmic Honey</p>
																								  <p>&nbsp;</p>
																								  <p>The video is a visual metaphor of existential freedom, predominance 
																									of essence over existence, and conditionality of boundaries it also has a
																									sculptural dimension related to the evolution of form. The space as a 
																									black absolute presented as an allegory of authentic freedom as well as 
																									the narrative links to the discourse of how the consciousness and 
																									existence are related to each other.</p>
